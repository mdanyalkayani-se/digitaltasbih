A distraction-free digital tasbih counter — designed to support quiet remembrance and mindful reflection, anywhere and anytime.

## 📚 Purpose

I built **Digital Tasbih** as a calm, clutter-free space for daily dhikr.
In a world full of noise and notifications, I wanted to create something intentionally simple — where you can pause, reflect, and recenter.

This project reflects my interest in using tech for **stillness**, not stimulation.
